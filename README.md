tu-archive-importer
===================

**NOTE: I haven't tried this in like 2+ years... it should still work, but no promises. Also it's horrible code. Sorry.**

A wonderfully simple tool to import your Twitter archive into ThinkUp.

Instructions
------------
Put your tweet JS files in 'tweets'... it should look like this: http://d.pr/i/pkoP
Run it from the CLI. Config the DB in the actual import.php file (yes, I know, bad practice... but this is a hacky script, so screw you)

Note
----
This is very much beta. Make a backup before you run this.

Thanks
------
HUGE thanks to [@henriwatson](https://github.com/henriwatson) for writing the tweet parsing code. I procrastinated on it and then he was awesome and did it for me.
